HALO – MVP OVERVIEW

Purpose:
Halo helps roofing contractors turn real neighborhood damage into verified, high-intent leads. It does this by hosting simple, localized splash pages (QR-driven landing pages) that showcase authentic photos of storm damage and invite nearby homeowners to request inspections.

1. Core Problem

Roofing contractors struggle to capture attention from nearby homeowners after storms. Stock imagery and generic ads don’t convert well because they lack proximity and credibility. Homeowners trust what they can see near them.

2. Core Solution

Halo provides neighborhood-specific “micro-landing pages” that display real photos of local roof damage and capture lead information via a simple call-to-action form.
Each page is accessed through a unique QR code distributed by the contractor (door hangers, yard signs, flyers, etc.).
When a homeowner scans the QR, they see nearby damage and can instantly request a roof inspection.

3. MVP Objective

Prove that:

Homeowners are more likely to submit contact info when they see authentic local damage.

Contractors can use Halo to generate qualified leads in specific neighborhoods with minimal setup.

Success metric: At least one lead submission from a single QR-driven page in a real neighborhood campaign.

4. MVP User Roles

1. Contractor (Primary User)

Requests a Halo page for a specific neighborhood.

Uploads 3–5 real photos of local damage.

Receives a shareable QR code linking to that page.

Gets notified when a homeowner submits a lead.

2. Homeowner (Visitor)

Scans QR code → views page showing damage from their area.

Enters contact info to request an inspection or quote.

Optionally uploads their own photo (future feature).

5. MVP Flow (Single Campaign Loop)

Contractor Campaign Setup

Contractor fills out a short form: name, company, phone/email, target neighborhood.

Uploads 3–5 photos of local damage.

Halo auto-generates a “Neighborhood Splash Page” and a matching QR code.

QR Distribution

Contractor prints QR on flyers, signs, or door hangers and distributes locally.

Homeowner Engagement

Homeowner scans QR → lands on Halo page.

Sees “Real Roof Damage From Your Neighborhood” with uploaded photos.

CTA: “Check My Roof / Request Free Inspection.”

Submits name, address, phone/email.

Lead Capture

Submission is stored and forwarded to the contractor.

Contractor is notified via email or dashboard (depending on tech decision).

Halo logs campaign analytics (views, leads).

6. MVP Feature Set (Bare Minimum)

Public Site (Homeowner-facing)

Clean landing page template (headline, damage photos, CTA form).

Responsive design (mobile-first).

Lead capture form connected to backend.

Admin / Contractor Side

Simple campaign setup form (manual or automated).

Photo upload (3–5 images).

QR code generation for page URL.

Basic lead notification (email or dashboard).

Data Handling

Store lead data (name, contact info, timestamp, campaign ID).

Associate each lead with the contractor who owns the campaign.

Basic reporting (view count and leads per campaign).

7. Future Expansion (Post-MVP Ideas)

(Not for first build — just to guide architecture decisions)

Multiple template styles (modern, urgent, neighborhood-pride, etc.).

Automated neighborhood targeting via maps/storm data.

Photo geotag verification to confirm authenticity.

Subscription billing for contractors.

Mobile field app for reps to snap and upload photos live.

8. MVP Deliverables

One fully functional campaign cycle:

One contractor, one neighborhood, one hosted splash page.

Working QR code linking to it.

Working form submission that sends lead data to contractor.

When that works end-to-end, Halo’s MVP is validated.
