## Sprint Backlog

### 1. Lead Notification System [E4-S1]
**Priority:** P0
**Estimated:** 4-5 hours

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Choose email service:
  - **Option 1:** Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP (free, quick setup)
  - **Option 2:** SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
  - **Option 3:** AWS SES (pay as you go, reliable)
- [ ] Set up email service:
  - Create account
  - Get API key or SMTP credentials
  - Store credentials in .env file
  - Test basic email sending
- [ ] Design email template:

    - Name, phone, email, address
    - Additional notes (if provided)
    - Timestamp
  - Campaign context:
    - Neighborhood name
    - Landing page URL
  - Call-to-action:
    - "Contact this homeowner within 24 hours for best results"
  - Footer: Powered by Halo
- [ ] Build email sending function:

  - Fetch contractor email from database
  - Populate email template with lead details
  - Send email
  - Return success/failure
- [ ] Integrate with lead submission:
  - Trigger email immediately after lead saved to database
  - Use async function (don't block form submission)
  - Handle email failures gracefully (log error, don't crash)
- [ ] Implement error handling:
  - Retry failed emails (1-2 retries)
  - Log email failures to database (for manual follow-up)
  - Alert if email service is down
- [ ] Add email logging:
  - Log all sent emails (to/from, timestamp, status)
  - Track deliverability (optional: use email service webhooks)
- [ ] Test email notifications:
  - Submit test lead
  - Verify email received within 1 minute
  - Check email renders correctly (desktop, mobile email clients)
  - Test spam filters (check spam folder)
  - Verify all lead details included correctly

**Email Template Example:**

```
