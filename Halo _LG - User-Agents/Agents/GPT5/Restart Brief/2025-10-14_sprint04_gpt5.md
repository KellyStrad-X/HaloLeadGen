# Restart Brief

**Prepared:** 2025-10-14 02:05 UTC  
**Prepared By:** GPT-5 (Project Manager)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 – Integration, Testing & Launch  
**Session Duration:** ~4 hours (recovery + production support)

---

## 1. Current Objective

### Primary Goal
Stabilize the production deployment by wiring Firebase Admin credentials, verifying campaign creation flow end-to-end, and documenting environment configuration for future work.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production build succeeds with Firebase Admin credentials in place.
- [ ] Contractor campaign flow (create → upload photos → QR generation) works on https://www.haloleadgen.com.
- [ ] Lead submission sends notification email to contractor inbox.

**Backlog Reference:** Sprint 4 checklist (SPRINT_04_Integration_Launch.md – Integration & Launch tasks)

## 2. Latest Status

### Completed This Session
1. **Reviewed Sprint 3 deliverables & repository status** – 0.5h  
   - Files: `app/create-campaign/page.tsx`, `components/*`, `app/api/*`, `lib/firestore.ts`  
   - Notes: Confirmed Sprint 3 code merged; identified missing env documentation.

2. **Production domain + DNS configuration** – 0.75h  
   - Actions: Guided user through Vercel DNS records (`www` CNAME, apex A), verified `www.haloleadgen.com`.  
   - Tested via browser access; SSL pending but auto-provisioned.

3. **Environment variable alignment & documentation** – 1.0h  
   - Files: `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `lib/firebase-admin.ts` (later)  
   - Added service-account ignore patterns, explained client/server env exposure, logged setup in GPT5 log.

4. **Firebase Admin storage migration** – 1.25h  
   - Files: `lib/firebase-admin.ts`, `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts`, `app/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr/route.ts`, `package.json`  
   - Added `firebase-admin`, created admin helper, switched uploads + QR generation to Admin SDK, generated signed download URLs; fixed type mapping bug; pushed commits `fix: use firebase admin for storage uploads`, `fix: map firebase service account fields`.

5. **Repository logging & env example update** – 0.5h  
   - Files: `Agents/GPT5/logs/2025-10-14_project_recovery_log.md`, `.env.example`  
   - Captured recovery log for handoff, added `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` guidance; committed `docs: add firebase admin to env example`.

**Total Progress:** ~70% of current stabilization task complete (deployment almost ready; build still failing due to eager env check).

### Outstanding Subtasks
- [ ] **Lazy-load Firebase Admin initialization** – Owner: Claude/GPT5, Est: 0.75h  
  - Dependencies: Ensure `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` present locally & in Vercel Production.  
  - Blocker: Build currently fails because env parsed during import.

- [ ] **Production, end-to-end verification** – Owner: Claude/user, Est: 1.0h  
  - Notes: Requires redeploy after above fix; test campaign creation, photo upload, QR, lead email.

- [ ] **Optional image compression strategy** – Owner: Future sprint, Est: 2h  
  - Notes: Mitigate 413 payload issues for large photos.

### Known Issues
- **Build failure when `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` absent**  
  - Severity: High (blocks deploy)  
  - Attempted fixes: Added Admin helper; currently throws if env missing.  
  - Next steps: Modify helper to lazily initialize and provide clearer instructions/logging.

- **Large photo uploads hit Vercel payload limit (>4–10 MB)**  
  - Severity: Medium  
  - Mitigation: For now, compress manually; plan client-side compression/direct storage upload later.

## 3. Key Decisions & References

### Decisions Made This Session
1. **Use Firebase Admin SDK for server uploads** – 2025-10-14  
   - **Context:** Browser SDK in serverless functions caused 404 + token issues; required authenticated uploads.  
   - **Options:** (A) keep browser SDK, (B) shift to Admin SDK, (C) direct REST upload.  
   - **Chosen:** B – Admin SDK.  
   - **Rationale:** Provides authenticated access, simpler download URLs, avoids client tokens.  
   - **Logged:** `Agents/GPT5/logs/2025-10-14_project_recovery_log.md`.

2. **Document Firebase Admin credentials via env var** – 2025-10-14  
   - **Context:** Service-account JSON accidentally kept locally; needed shared guidance.  
   - **Options:** (A) commit file (bad), (B) env var string, (C) secret manager.  
   - **Chosen:** B.  
   - **Rationale:** Works with Vercel and local `.env.local`, keeps secrets out of repo.

### Important References
- **Branches:**  
  - Current work: `main` (latest commit `d60d867 docs: add firebase admin to env example`)  
  - No feature branches open.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Sprint 3 plan: `Backlog-Sprints/Sprints/SPRINT_03_Campaign_Setup.md`  
  - Sprint 4 plan: `Backlog-Sprints/Sprints/SPRINT_04_Integration_Launch.md`  
  - Restart log: `Agents/GPT5/logs/2025-10-14_project_recovery_log.md`

- **Assets:**  
  - Production domain: `www.haloleadgen.com`  
  - Firebase project: `haloleadgen` (assumed from service account naming)

### Coordination Notes
- **Codex Review:** Not requested during this session.  
- **Last Sync:** 2025-10-14 with user for production troubleshooting.  
- **Next Sync:** When Claude resumes Sprint 4 tasks (email + deployment verification).

## 4. Next Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Lazy initialization of Firebase Admin** – Est: 0.75h  
   - Action: Refactor `lib/firebase-admin.ts` to return `getAdminApp()`/`getAdminStorage()` that parse env lazily; throw with descriptive error if missing at runtime.  
   - Files: `lib/firebase-admin.ts`, adjust import sites (`app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts`, `/generate-qr`).  
   - Test: `npm run build`; ensure no env error when variable missing during build.

2. **Redeploy & verify production env** – Est: 0.5h  
   - Action: Confirm `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is set in Vercel Production; trigger redeploy; monitor logs.  
   - Dependencies: Step 1 complete.

3. **Manual end-to-end test on production** – Est: 1.0h  
   - Action: Create campaign, upload 1–2 photos, confirm QR generation, submit lead, verify email arrival, check Firestore/Storage entries.  
   - Test: Browser dev tools + Firebase console.

### Testing Plan
- [ ] `npm run build` locally after admin init change.  
- [ ] Manual test on production (`www.haloleadgen.com`).  
- [ ] Confirm email arrives at `notifications@haloleadgen.com`.  
- [ ] Verify Firestore documents (campaign, photos, leads) via Firebase console.  
- [ ] Optional: run `npm run debug:firestore` / `cleanup:firestore` scripts as needed.

### Code Review Prep
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` (note: Next.js warning about SWC to resolve by running `next dev`).  
- [ ] No automated tests yet (manual verification).  
- [ ] Update docs if behaviour changes (README or sprint logs).  
- [ ] Summarize changes for potential PR (if branching later).

### Risks & Blockers
- **Risk:** Auto-deploy on `main` publishes partial fixes.  
  - Likelihood: Medium – high commit frequency.  
  - Impact: Medium – broken prod while debugging.  
  - Mitigation: Consider disabling auto-deploy or using staging branch once stable.

- **Blocker:** `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` env not accessible in some environments.  
  - Blocked on: Implementation refactor (Step 1).  
  - Workaround: None; required for build to pass.  
  - Escalation: No (in-progress).

## 5. Stakeholder Notes

### Pending Questions
1. **Do we want client-side image compression now or defer?**  
   - For: Product Owner / Claude  
   - Urgency: Nice-to-have (current workaround is smaller images).

2. **Should auto deploy on `main` remain active?**  
   - For: Product Owner  
   - Context: Frequent debugging pushes trigger production rebuilds.

### Commitments & Deadlines
- **Sprint 4 target:** TBD (not formally set post-crash).  
- **Current task target:** Stabilize production + email notifications ASAP.  
- **Next demo:** Not scheduled.  
- **External dependencies:** Firebase project access, Google Workspace credentials (already configured).

### Communication Log
- **Last update sent:** 2025-10-14 – `Agents/GPT5/logs/2025-10-14_project_recovery_log.md`.  
- **Last feedback received:** 2025-10-14 – user confirming env confusion & requesting guidance.

## 8. Handoff Context

### For Incoming Agent
1. Read this brief, then open `Agents/GPT5/logs/2025-10-14_project_recovery_log.md` for detailed session narrative.  
2. Pull latest `main` (commit `d60d867`).  
3. Review modified files:  
   - `lib/firebase-admin.ts` – new admin helper (needs lazy init refactor).  
   - `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts` & `/generate-qr/route.ts` – rely on admin storage.  
   - `.env.example` – check env expectations.  
4. Ensure local `.env.local` contains all env vars (especially `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`).  
5. Address “Next Action Plan” in order.

**Key Files to Review:**
- `lib/firebase-admin.ts` – Understand Admin app initialization and required change.  
- `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts` – Photo upload flow, Admin SDK usage.  
- `app/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr/route.ts` – QR storage.  
- `lib/mailer.ts` & `app/api/leads/route.ts` – Email notifications, rely on SMTP env.

**Context Summary:**  
Deployment recovered post-crash; Sprint 3 deliverables live. Sprint 4 focus is verifying email notifications and production stability. Currently blocked by build-time env requirement; need to refactor admin initialization and redeploy, then finish production QA.
