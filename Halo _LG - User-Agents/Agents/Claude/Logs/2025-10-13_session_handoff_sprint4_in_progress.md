## Critical Issue: Build Failure

### Problem

Build fails during `next build` with:
```
Error: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is not set. Add it to your environment variables.
    at lib/firebase-admin.ts
```

### Root Cause

**What happened between sessions:**
- After Sprint 3 completion, Firebase Admin SDK was added
- Photo uploads and QR generation now use Admin SDK (server-side)
- This requires `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable
- Variable exists in user's `.env.local` (working locally)
- Variable is **NOT** in build environment (CI/CD)

**Why it breaks build:**
- Next.js builds all API routes during `next build`
- Routes import `firebase-admin.ts`
- `firebase-admin.ts` throws error if env var missing
- Build fails before deployment

### Files Using Firebase Admin SDK

1. `lib/firebase-admin.ts` - Admin SDK initialization
2. `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts` - Photo uploads
3. `app/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr/route.ts` - QR code generation

**Git commits showing this change:**
```
b7b97bd fix: map firebase service account fields
8f12fc4 fix: use firebase admin for storage uploads
```

### Solution Required

**Option 1: Make Admin SDK Optional During Build** (Recommended)
- Wrap firebase-admin initialization in try-catch
- Return null/dummy storage if not initialized
- Only throw error at runtime when actually needed
- This allows build to succeed without service account

**Option 2: Add Service Account to Build Environment**
- Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to Vercel env vars
- Requires service account JSON from Firebase Console
- More secure but harder to set up

**Option 3: Revert to Client SDK** (Not Recommended)
- Undo the firebase-admin changes
- Go back to client-side Firebase Storage SDK
- Loses server-side upload benefits

**I recommend Option 1** - make it optional during build, required at runtime.

## What Works Right Now (Locally)

### Full MVP Flow Tested and Working ‚úÖ

**Contractor Side:**
1. ‚úÖ Go to `/create-campaign`
2. ‚úÖ Fill out contractor info (name, company, email, phone, neighborhood)
3. ‚úÖ Upload photos (tested with 5-10 photos)
4. ‚úÖ Photos upload to Firebase Storage
5. ‚úÖ QR code generates automatically (1024x1024px PNG)
6. ‚úÖ QR code saved to Firebase Storage
7. ‚úÖ Redirect to success page with downloadable QR
8. ‚úÖ Download QR code (works)
9. ‚úÖ Copy landing page URL (works)

**Homeowner Side:**
10. ‚úÖ Scan QR code (tested on mobile via local IP)
11. ‚úÖ Landing page loads with photos
12. ‚úÖ Fill out lead form
13. ‚úÖ Submit lead
14. ‚úÖ Lead saved to Firestore
15. ‚úÖ Email notification sent to contractor
16. ‚úÖ Email arrives within seconds
17. ‚úÖ Email is beautifully formatted with all details

**This is a fully functional MVP!** Just needs to be deployed.

## Environment Configuration

### Local Environment (Working)

**`.env.local` contains:**
```bash
# Firebase Client (public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=haloleadgen-b0153.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=haloleadgen-b0153
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=haloleadgen-b0153.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Firebase Admin (server only)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...full JSON...}

# Email (working)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=notifications@haloleadgen.com
SMTP_PASS=ptwbdcizfuezhkdg  # App password (no spaces)
SMTP_FROM=notifications@haloleadgen.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Halo Lead Generation

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Environment (Needed for Vercel)

**All of the above PLUS:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://haloleadgen.com
```

**Note:** Firebase Storage bucket is `.firebasestorage.app` (new format, not `.appspot.com`)
- This caused issues with scripts but works in app
- Keep as is: `haloleadgen-b0153.appspot.com` for now

---

## Domain & Infrastructure Setup

### Google Workspace (Configured)
- ‚úÖ Domain: `haloleadgen.com` purchased through Google Workspace
- ‚úÖ Email: `notifications@haloleadgen.com` created
- ‚úÖ 2FA enabled on email account
- ‚úÖ App Password generated and tested
- ‚úÖ SMTP working perfectly

### Vercel (Ready to Deploy)
- ‚úÖ User has/will create Vercel Pro account ($20/month)
- ‚úÖ GitHub repo: `KellyStrad-X/HaloLeadGen`
- ‚úÖ Branch: `main`
- ‚è≥ Needs: Connect repo to Vercel
- ‚è≥ Needs: Add environment variables
- ‚è≥ Needs: Fix build issue first

### Firebase (Configured)
- ‚úÖ Project: `haloleadgen-b0153`
- ‚úÖ Firestore: Enabled, test mode rules
- ‚úÖ Storage: Enabled, test mode rules
- ‚è≥ **TODO:** Tighten security rules before going fully public
- ‚è≥ **TODO:** Consider switching to production mode rules

### DNS (Pending)
- Domain currently with Google Workspace
- Will need to point to Vercel:
  - A record or CNAME for `haloleadgen.com` ‚Üí Vercel
  - Keep MX records for Google email
- Vercel will provide DNS records after connecting

---

## Technical Decisions Made Today

### 1. Email Service: Google Workspace + Nodemailer
**Why:** User already setting up Workspace, professional email address, reliable SMTP
**Alternative Considered:** SendGrid, AWS SES
**Result:** Working perfectly, fast delivery, professional sender

### 2. Deployment Platform: Vercel Pro
**Why:** Next.js optimized, easy deployment, Pro plan for commercial use
**Cost:** $20/month
**Alternative Considered:** Hobby plan (rejected - violates ToS for commercial)

### 3. Email Template: HTML with Inline Styles
**Why:** Best compatibility across email clients
**Result:** Renders beautifully on desktop and mobile email clients

### 4. Email Sending: Async, Non-Blocking
**Why:** Don't delay form submission if email is slow
**Result:** User gets instant success message, email sends in background

---

## Known Issues & Blockers

### üö® BLOCKER: Build Fails Without Service Account
**Status:** BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT
**Priority:** P0 - Must fix before deploy
**Impact:** Cannot deploy to Vercel until resolved
**Solution:** Make firebase-admin optional during build (see issue section above)

### üü° Warning: Firebase Storage Bucket Format
**Issue:** `.firebasestorage.app` vs `.appspot.com`
**Status:** Working but confusing
**Impact:** Low - works fine, but scripts had issues
**Solution:** Leave as is for now, document clearly

### üü° Warning: Firebase Rules in Test Mode
**Issue:** Firestore and Storage rules allow all read/write
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP testing
**Impact:** Security risk if goes fully public
**Solution:** Tighten before marketing/scale (on todo list)

### üü¢ Minor: Firebase Admin Added Post-Sprint 3
**Issue:** Architecture changed between sessions without my knowledge
**Status:** Understood now
**Impact:** None - better architecture for server-side uploads
**Note:** Just need to handle build-time gracefully

## Code Quality & Technical Debt

### Strengths ‚úÖ
- Clean TypeScript throughout
- Good separation of concerns (lib files)
- Professional email template
- Proper error handling in email system
- Non-blocking email sending
- Comprehensive logging

### Technical Debt to Address Later
- No email retry logic (if send fails, it's lost)
- No email queue system (sends immediately)
- No analytics tracking (page views, conversions)
- No rate limiting on API routes
- Firebase rules too permissive (test mode)
- No monitoring/alerting set up
- No backup strategy for Firestore
- SQLite files still in repo (legacy, unused)

### Post-MVP Improvements
- Add email queue (Bull, BeeQueue, or SQS)
- Add retry logic for failed emails
- Track email deliverability
- Add Sentry for error tracking
- Add analytics (Plausible or GA)
- Set up uptime monitoring
- Implement proper backup strategy
- Clean up legacy SQLite code

## Questions for Tomorrow

### For User
1. **Vercel Account:** Already created or need to create?
2. **Domain DNS:** Ready to update or want to test on *.vercel.app first?
3. **Firebase Service Account JSON:** Have it handy for deployment?
4. **Testing:** Want to test on Vercel subdomain before custom domain?

### Technical Decisions Needed
1. **Build Fix Approach:** Confirm Option 1 (make admin SDK optional) is acceptable
2. **Security Rules:** Update now or after initial production testing?
3. **Domain Strategy:** Use apex (`haloleadgen.com`) or subdomain (`app.haloleadgen.com`)?
4. **Monitoring:** Add Sentry now or post-MVP?
