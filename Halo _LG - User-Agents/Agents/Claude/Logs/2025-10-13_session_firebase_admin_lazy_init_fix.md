# Sprint 4 Session: Firebase Admin Lazy Initialization Fix
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Session Focus:** Resolving build blocker for Vercel deployment
**Status:** ✅ Build blocker resolved, ready for testing & deployment

---

## Executive Summary

This session successfully resolved the critical build failure blocking Vercel deployment. The Firebase Admin SDK was initializing at import time, throwing errors when `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` wasn't available during builds. Implemented lazy initialization pattern that defers SDK initialization until runtime when API routes are actually called.

**Critical Achievement:** `npm run build` now succeeds ✅
**Next Milestone:** Test locally, commit changes, redeploy to production, verify end-to-end

---

## Session Context & Background

### What Happened Before This Session

**Previous Work (User + GPT5):**
- Sprint 3 completion log was created (~1,630 lines documenting campaign wizard, photo uploads, QR generation)
- Sprint 4 email notifications were implemented (Nodemailer + Google Workspace)
- Firebase Admin SDK was added for server-side storage uploads
- Production deployed to www.haloleadgen.com on Vercel Pro
- All environment variables configured in Vercel Production

**The Blocker:**
Build was failing with error:
```
Error: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is not set. Add it to your environment variables.
    at lib/firebase-admin.ts
```

**Root Cause:**
`lib/firebase-admin.ts` was doing `const app = initializeApp(...)` at the top level, causing immediate initialization when the module was imported. During builds, this threw an error because the env var wasn't available in all build contexts.

### Project State When Session Started

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Production domain: www.haloleadgen.com (CNAME + apex A records configured)
- ✅ Fallback domain: halo-lead-gen.vercel.app
- ✅ Vercel Pro plan activated
- ⚠️ Builds failing due to Firebase Admin SDK initialization

**Environment Variables (All configured in Vercel Production):**
- Firebase client: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables
- Firebase Admin: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (single-line JSON)
- SMTP: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`
- App: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

**Features Complete:**
- ✅ Contractor wizard (3-step campaign creation)
- ✅ Photo uploads to Firebase Storage (via Admin SDK)
- ✅ QR code generation and storage (via Admin SDK)
- ✅ Landing pages with lead capture forms
- ✅ Email notifications to contractors (Nodemailer + Gmail)
- ✅ Success page with downloadable assets

**Firebase Security:**
- ⚠️ Firestore: Test mode (allow all read/write) - needs tightening for production
- ⚠️ Storage: Test mode (allow all read/write) - needs tightening for production

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. Analyzed the Problem Together

**User's Input:**
User provided comprehensive status update explaining:
- Production was already deployed at www.haloleadgen.com
- Build was failing on `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` check
- Root cause was import-time initialization vs. runtime initialization
- Need for lazy initialization pattern

**Discussion:**
- I initially started making changes without discussion
- User correctly stopped me and asked to work it out together first
- We agreed on lazy getter approach before implementing

### 2. Implemented Lazy Initialization Pattern

**File: `lib/firebase-admin.ts`**

**Before (Immediate Initialization):**
```typescript
const app =
  getApps().length === 0
    ? initializeApp({
        credential: cert(getServiceAccount()), // ❌ Throws immediately if env var missing
        storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
      })
    : getApps()[0];

export const adminStorage = getStorage(app).bucket();
```

**After (Lazy Initialization):**
```typescript
// Lazy initialization - only initialize when actually needed
let app: App | null = null;

function getAdminApp(): App {
  if (app) {
    return app;
  }

  // Check if already initialized
  const existingApps = getApps();
  if (existingApps.length > 0) {
    app = existingApps[0];
    return app;
  }

  // Initialize now (will throw if FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is missing)
  app = initializeApp({
    credential: cert(getServiceAccount()), // ✅ Only throws at runtime when actually used
    storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  });

  return app;
}

export function getAdminStorage() {
  return getStorage(getAdminApp()).bucket();
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from `export const adminStorage` to `export function getAdminStorage()`
- App initialization deferred until `getAdminApp()` is called
- Singleton pattern ensures app only initializes once
- Build succeeds even without env var; runtime fails fast if missing when actually needed

### 3. Updated API Routes to Use Lazy Getter

**File: `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts`**
- Changed import: `import { adminStorage }` → `import { getAdminStorage }`
- Added in handler: `const adminStorage = getAdminStorage();` (line 69)
- Bucket access now triggers lazy initialization only when route executes

**File: `app/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr/route.ts`**
- Changed import: `import { adminStorage }` → `import { getAdminStorage }`
- Added in handler: `const adminStorage = getAdminStorage();` (line 44)
- Same lazy initialization pattern

### 4. Verified Build Success

**Command:** `npm run build`

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 3.4s
✓ Generating static pages (8/8)

Route (app)                                 Size  First Load JS
├ ○ /                                      135 B         102 kB

├ ƒ /c/[slug]                            3.07 kB         105 kB
├ ƒ /campaign/[id]/success               2.43 kB         104 kB
├ ○ /create-campaign                     4.01 kB         106 kB
└ ○ /debug-firebase                      74.9 kB         177 kB
```

**What This Means:**
- Build completes without requiring `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` in build environment
- All API routes build successfully
- Static pages pre-render correctly
- Production deployment should succeed

## Current Technical State

### Architecture Overview

**Stack:**
- Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router)
- Firebase Firestore (database)
- Firebase Storage (photos, QR codes) - using Admin SDK
- Firebase Admin SDK v12.5.0 (server-side operations)
- Nodemailer v7.0.9 (email notifications)
- React Hook Form (form management)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

**Email Flow:**
1. Lead submits form on landing page (`/c/[slug]`)
2. API route `/api/leads` saves to Firestore
3. Async call to `sendLeadNotification()` from `lib/mailer.ts`
4. Email sent via SMTP (notifications@haloleadgen.com) to contractor's email
5. Contractor receives HTML email with lead details

**Storage Flow:**
1. Contractor uploads photo in campaign wizard
2. `PhotoUpload` component sends to `/api/campaigns/[id]/photos`
3. API calls `getAdminStorage()` which lazy-initializes Firebase Admin
4. Photo uploaded to Firebase Storage with download token
5. Public URL returned and saved to Firestore

**QR Code Flow:**
1. Contractor clicks "Generate QR Code" on success page
2. Frontend calls `/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr`
3. API generates QR from landing page URL
4. Calls `getAdminStorage()` which lazy-initializes Firebase Admin
5. QR uploaded to Storage, URL saved to campaign document

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**

**Firebase Client (Public - safe to expose):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=haloleadgen-b0153.firebaseapp.com

   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Create a test campaign
   - Upload a photo (tests `getAdminStorage()` in photos route)
   - Generate QR code (tests `getAdminStorage()` in QR route)
   - Verify no errors with lazy initialization
   - **Why:** Confirm lazy init doesn't break runtime functionality

2. **Commit Changes to GitHub**
   - Stage modified files:
     - `lib/firebase-admin.ts`
     - `app/api/campaigns/[id]/photos/route.ts`
     - `app/api/campaigns/[id]/generate-qr/route.ts`
   - Commit message:
     ```
     fix: implement lazy initialization for Firebase Admin SDK

     - Prevents build failures when FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is not available
     - Defers admin app initialization until runtime when APIs are called
     - Changed adminStorage export to getAdminStorage() function
     - Updated photo upload and QR generation routes to use getter

     Fixes build blocker for Vercel deployment.

     ```
   - Push to `main` branch
   - **Why:** Trigger Vercel auto-deploy with fixed build

3. **Monitor Vercel Deployment**
   - Watch Vercel dashboard for new deployment
   - Verify build succeeds (should now pass with lazy init)
   - Check deployment logs for any warnings
   - Confirm deployment goes live
   - **Why:** Ensure production gets the fix

4. **Test Production End-to-End**
   - Visit www.haloleadgen.com/create-campaign
   - Create a real test campaign:
     - Enter contractor info (use real test email for notifications)
     - Upload 2-3 photos
     - Generate campaign
   - On success page:
     - Click "Generate QR Code"
     - Verify QR appears and is downloadable
     - Copy landing page URL
   - Visit landing page (www.haloleadgen.com/c/[slug])
   - Submit a test lead with real info
   - Check contractor email for notification
   - **Why:** Verify all features work in production with lazy init

5. **Tighten Firebase Security Rules** (Post-Launch)
   - Current state: Test mode (allow all)
   - Need to update Firestore rules:
     - Contractors: Allow create, read own
     - Campaigns: Allow create, read own, update own
     - Photos: Allow create for campaign owner
     - Leads: Allow create (public), read by campaign owner
   - Need to update Storage rules:
     - Photos: Allow upload by campaign owner, read by all
     - QR codes: Allow create by system, read by all
   - **Why:** Production security best practices
   - **When:** After successful production testing

6. **Create Sprint 4 Completion Log**
   - Document entire Sprint 4 journey:
     - Email notification implementation
     - Google Workspace setup
     - SMTP configuration
     - Firebase Admin SDK addition (between sessions)
     - Build blocker issue
     - Lazy initialization solution
     - Production deployment
     - End-to-end testing results
   - Follow same template as Sprint 3 log
   - Save to: `Agents/Claude/Logs/2025-10-13_sprint04_email_notifications_complete.md`
   - **Why:** Documentation for handoffs and future reference

### Optional Enhancements (Post-Sprint 4)

1. **Client-Side Image Compression**
   - Current: 10MB max file size, uploaded as-is
   - Enhancement: Compress images client-side before upload
   - Libraries: `browser-image-compression` or `compressorjs`
   - **Why:** Reduce storage costs, faster uploads, better UX

2. **Vercel Deploy Settings**
   - Consider: Disable auto-deploy on `main` in Vercel dashboard
   - Alternative: Use `dev` branch for testing, manual promote to production
   - **Why:** More control over production deployments

3. **Error Monitoring**
   - Add Sentry or similar
   - Track production errors
   - Monitor email delivery failures
   - **Why:** Proactive issue detection

4. **Real Campaign Validation**
   - Deploy real contractor campaign
   - Print physical QR codes
   - Test scannability in field
   - Measure conversion rates
   - **Why:** Validate product-market fit

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Issues Resolved This Session

✅ **Build Failure (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT)** - RESOLVED
- Issue: Import-time initialization caused builds to fail
- Solution: Lazy initialization pattern implemented
- Status: Build succeeds, ready for deployment

### Outstanding Issues

⚠️ **Firebase Security Rules in Test Mode**
- Issue: Both Firestore and Storage allow all read/write
- Impact: Security risk if scaled, but acceptable for MVP testing
- Plan: Tighten after production validation
- Priority: Medium (post-launch)

⚠️ **No Error Monitoring in Production**
- Issue: No Sentry or error tracking configured
- Impact: Won't know about production errors unless users report
- Plan: Consider adding in future sprint
- Priority: Low (nice to have)

### Warnings & Caveats

⚠️ **FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT Format**
- Must be single-line JSON
- Private key newlines must be escaped as `\\n` (double backslash)
- Common mistake: Using `\n` (single) instead of `\\n` (double)
- Validation: Try parsing JSON in Node REPL before adding to Vercel

⚠️ **Email Deliverability**
- Currently using Google Workspace SMTP with app password
- May hit rate limits if sending high volume
- Consider SendGrid/SES for production scale
- Monitor Gmail spam reports

⚠️ **QR Code Print Quality**
- Generated at 1024x1024px with high error correction
- Should scan well when printed
- Recommend testing physical prints before mass distribution
- Different printers may produce varying quality

---

## Debugging & Troubleshooting Guide

### If Build Fails Again

**Symptom:** `npm run build` fails with "FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT is not set"

**Check:**
1. Verify `lib/firebase-admin.ts` has lazy initialization (not import-time `const app =`)
2. Ensure all uses of `adminStorage` changed to `getAdminStorage()`
3. Check for any new code importing firebase-admin directly

**Fix:**
- Review changes in this session's files as reference
- Ensure getter pattern is used everywhere

### If Photo Upload Fails in Production

**Symptom:** Photo upload returns 500 error or "Failed to upload photo"

**Check:**
1. Vercel logs for actual error message
2. `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is set in Vercel environment variables
3. Service account JSON is valid (test parsing locally)
4. Storage bucket name matches Firebase project

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test service account JSON locally
node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT))"
```

### If QR Code Generation Fails

**Symptom:** "Generate QR Code" button doesn't work or shows error

**Check:**
1. Same as photo upload (uses same admin storage)
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is correct in Vercel
3. Campaign has valid `pageSlug`

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Check Vercel function logs for backend errors

### If Email Doesn't Send

**Symptom:** Lead submits but contractor doesn't receive email

**Check:**
1. Vercel logs for email sending errors
2. All `SMTP_*` environment variables set correctly
3. Google Workspace app password is correct (16 chars, no spaces)
4. Contractor email in campaign is valid

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test SMTP connection locally
node -e "
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: 'notifications@haloleadgen.com',
    pass: 'ptwbdcizfuezhkdg'
  }
});
transport.verify().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
"
```

### If Landing Page Doesn't Load

**Symptom:** `/c/[slug]` shows 404 or error

**Check:**
1. Campaign exists in Firestore
2. `pageSlug` matches URL exactly
3. Firebase client config is correct in Vercel

**Common Causes:**
- Typo in slug
- Campaign deleted from Firestore
- Firebase client credentials missing

## Key Learnings This Session

### Communication & Collaboration

**What Worked Well:**
- User stopping me to discuss approach before implementing
- Working out the solution together rather than me charging ahead
- User providing comprehensive status update before we started
- Clear agreement on approach before making changes

**What I'll Remember:**
- Always check what other agents (like GPT5) have been working on
- Discuss technical approach with user before modifying code
- Don't assume I know the full context even with a summary
- User may have already made progress I'm not aware of

### Technical Insights

**Lazy Initialization Pattern:**
- Critical for SDK/service initialization in serverless environments
- Build time ≠ runtime - builds may not have all env vars
- Export functions instead of constants when initialization has side effects
- Singleton pattern prevents re-initialization on subsequent calls

**Next.js + Firebase Admin:**
- Admin SDK initialization at module scope causes build issues
- Vercel builds scan all API routes, triggering imports
- Solution: Defer initialization to first actual request
- Still maintain fail-fast behavior for missing credentials

**Build vs. Runtime Environments:**
- Vercel builds may have different env vars than production runtime
- Some env vars (like secrets) may only be available at runtime
- Build should succeed without runtime-only secrets
- Validate secrets when they're actually needed, not at import

## Questions for Next Session

These are questions the next agent should ask the user to continue effectively:

1. **Testing Results:**
   - "Did you test photo upload and QR generation locally after the lazy init changes?"
   - "Were there any errors or issues with the new `getAdminStorage()` function?"

2. **Deployment Status:**
   - "Have you committed the changes to GitHub yet?"
   - "Did Vercel auto-deploy successfully?"
   - "Did the production build succeed this time?"

3. **Production Testing:**
   - "Have you tested creating a campaign in production?"
   - "Did the email notification arrive correctly?"
   - "Are there any errors in the Vercel logs?"

4. **Next Priorities:**
   - "Should we tighten Firebase security rules now or after more testing?"
   - "Do you want to create the Sprint 4 completion log, or continue with enhancements?"
   - "Are there any issues that came up during testing we need to address?"

5. **User Preferences:**
   - "How do you want to handle future deployments - auto-deploy on push or manual?"
   - "Do you want to add error monitoring (like Sentry) now or later?"
   - "Should we focus on documentation or new features next?"
