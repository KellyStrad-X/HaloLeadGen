PLACEHOLDER - Add your slideshow images here

The Hero component expects these files:
- 1.jpg
- 2.jpg
- 3.jpg
- 4.jpg
- 5.jpg

Until you add real photos, the slideshow will attempt to load these files.
If they don't exist, you may see console errors (which is fine during development).

Just drop your selected photos in this folder with those exact names and the slideshow will work!
