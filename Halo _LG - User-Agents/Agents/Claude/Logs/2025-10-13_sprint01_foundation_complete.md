### 2. Tech Stack Selection & Configuration ✅

**What was done:**

**Technology choices:**
- **Next.js 15** - Full-stack React framework
- **TypeScript 5** - Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS 3.4** - Utility-first styling
- **SQLite (better-sqlite3)** - Development database
- **Nodemailer** - Email notifications (Sprint 4)
- **qrcode** - QR code generation (Sprint 3)

**Why Next.js:**
1. Handles both frontend AND backend (API routes)
2. Fast development with hot reload
3. Server-side rendering for SEO
4. Built-in TypeScript support
5. Easy Vercel deployment (zero config)
6. Production-ready (used by Netflix, Airbnb, TikTok)

**Setup completed:**
- Created `package.json` with all dependencies
- Ran `npm install` - 524 packages installed successfully
- Configured `next.config.js`:
  - Image optimization
  - Body size limit 10MB (for photo uploads)
- Configured `tsconfig.json` with strict typing
- Configured `tailwind.config.js` for utility classes
- Configured `postcss.config.js` for CSS processing
- Created Next.js app structure:
  - `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with metadata
  - `app/page.tsx` - Home page with status indicator
  - `app/globals.css` - Global styles with Tailwind

**Files created:**
- `package.json` (with custom npm scripts)
- `next.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- `misc/decisions/2025-10-13_tech-stack-selection.md` (full rationale)

**Commits:**
```
d206a2b - feat: set up Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind
```

**Testing:**
- Started Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`

**Time spent:** ~45 minutes

**Verification:**
- ✅ All packages installed
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ Dev server runs without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works
- ✅ Tailwind styles apply correctly
- ✅ Tech decision fully documented

---

### 3. Database Design & Implementation ✅

**What was done:**

**Schema Design:**

Created 4 tables with relationships:

1. **contractors** - Roofing contractors using Halo
   - id, name, company, email, phone, created_at
   - Primary table for contractor accounts

2. **campaigns** - Neighborhood-specific campaigns
   - id, contractor_id (FK), neighborhood_name, page_slug (unique), qr_code_path, created_at, status
   - Status: 'active', 'paused', 'completed'
   - Slug enables clean URLs: `/c/oak-ridge-dallas`

3. **leads** - Homeowner lead submissions
   - id, campaign_id (FK), name, address, email, phone, notes, submitted_at, status
   - Status: 'new', 'contacted', 'qualified', 'closed', 'lost'
   - Core business value - these are the leads contractors want

4. **photos** - Campaign damage photos (unlimited)
   - id, campaign_id (FK), image_path, upload_order, uploaded_at
   - Upload_order ensures photos display in correct sequence
   - No limit on photo count per campaign

**Indexes created for performance:**
- `idx_campaigns_contractor` - Fast lookup of contractor's campaigns
- `idx_campaigns_slug` - Fast landing page loading by URL slug
- `idx_leads_campaign` - Fast lead retrieval for a campaign
- `idx_leads_email_campaign` - Duplicate detection
- `idx_photos_campaign` - Fast photo loading
- `idx_photos_order` - Ordered photo retrieval

**Database abstraction layer (`lib/db.ts`):**
- Singleton pattern for database connection
- Auto-enables foreign keys (critical for SQLite)
- Enables WAL mode for better performance
- TypeScript interfaces for all table types
- Helper functions:
  - `getDb()` - Get database connection
  - `initializeSchema()` - Create tables from schema.sql
  - `isDatabaseInitialized()` - Check if DB exists
  - `closeDb()` - Clean shutdown
  - `generateSlug()` - URL-friendly slug generation
  - `isSlugUnique()` - Prevent duplicate slugs
  - `generateUniqueSlug()` - Auto-increment for collisions

**Database initialization script (`database/init.ts`):**
- Checks if DB already initialized
- Creates schema from `schema.sql`
- Optionally seeds test data
- CLI flags: `--seed` or `-s`
- Run with: `npx tsx database/init.ts --seed`

**Files created:**
- `database/schema.sql` - Complete SQL schema
- `lib/db.ts` - Database abstraction layer (247 lines)
- `database/init.ts` - Initialization script

**Commits:**
```
(Part of next commit - database work completed together)
```

**Time spent:** ~40 minutes

**Verification:**
- ✅ Schema is PostgreSQL-compatible for future migration
- ✅ Foreign key constraints work
- ✅ Indexes created successfully
- ✅ TypeScript types match database schema

---

### 4. Database Seeding & Testing ✅

**What was done:**

**Seed script (`database/seeds/seed.ts`):**

Created realistic test data:

**2 Contractors:**
1. John Smith - Smith Roofing & Repair
   - Email: john@smithroofing.com
   - Phone: 214-555-0101

2. Maria Garcia - Garcia Brothers Roofing
   - Email: maria@garciaroofing.com
   - Phone: 469-555-0202

**3 Campaigns:**
1. Oak Ridge Subdivision, Dallas TX
   - Slug: `oak-ridge-subdivision-dallas-tx`
   - Contractor: John Smith
   - 5 photos
   - 3 leads

2. Meadowbrook Heights, Fort Worth TX
   - Slug: `meadowbrook-heights-fort-worth-tx`
   - Contractor: John Smith
   - 3 photos
   - 1 lead

3. Lakeside Village, Plano TX
   - Slug: `lakeside-village-plano-tx`
   - Contractor: Maria Garcia
   - 0 photos (tests edge case)
   - 1 lead

**5 Leads with realistic data:**
- Sarah Johnson (Oak Ridge) - "Noticed some missing shingles after last storm" - Status: new
- Michael Chen (Oak Ridge) - "Water stains in attic" - Status: contacted
- Emily Rodriguez (Oak Ridge) - No notes - Status: new
- David Williams (Meadowbrook) - "Hail damage from last week" - Status: new
- Lisa Martinez (Lakeside) - "Need inspection before selling house" - Status: qualified

**8 Photos:**
- Campaign 1: 5 photos (roof-damage-1 through 5)
- Campaign 2: 3 photos (hail-damage-1 through 3)
- Campaign 3: 0 photos (tests no-photo case)

**Test queries script (`database/test-queries.ts`):**

Created comprehensive test suite verifying:

1. **Basic queries:** Get all contractors, campaigns
2. **COUNT queries:** Verify record counts
3. **JOIN queries:** Campaign + photos, Campaign + contractor
4. **Filtered queries:** Leads by campaign
5. **Slug lookup:** Critical for landing page routing
6. **Aggregate queries:** Photo counts per campaign

All 7 tests passed successfully.

**NPM scripts added:**
```json
"db:init": "tsx database/init.ts",
"db:seed": "tsx database/init.ts --seed",
"db:reset": "rm -f database/halo.db && npm run db:seed"
```

**Files created:**
- `database/seeds/seed.ts` - Test data seeder (164 lines)
- `database/test-queries.ts` - Query test suite (136 lines)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Next.js over separate frontend/backend

**Rationale:**
- Faster development (one codebase)
- Built-in API routes
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Easy deployment to Vercel
- No CORS issues

**Documented:** `misc/decisions/2025-10-13_tech-stack-selection.md`

### Decision 2: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

**Rationale:**
- SQLite: Zero setup, file-based, perfect for local dev
- PostgreSQL: Production-ready, scalable, industry standard
- Easy migration path (SQL standard compliant)

**Implementation:** Schema designed to be PostgreSQL-compatible

### Decision 3: Unlimited photos per campaign

**Rationale:**
- User requested: "There's no reason to cap the photos at 3-5"
- More photos = more compelling landing pages
- No technical limitation
- Implemented with `upload_order` for sequencing

---

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Database Design
- **Clean schema** with proper foreign keys and indexes
- **Slug generation** for SEO-friendly URLs
- **Status tracking** for campaigns and leads (state machine)
- **Upload order** for photo sequencing
- **PostgreSQL-compatible** for easy production migration

### 2. Code Quality
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **Singleton pattern** for database connection
- **Error handling** in database functions
- **Type interfaces** matching database schema
- **Clean separation** of concerns (db.ts abstracts all queries)

### 3. Developer Experience
- **NPM scripts** for common tasks
- **Seed data** for instant development
- **Test queries** for verification
- **Hot reload** during development
- **Clear documentation** at every level

### 4. Git Hygiene
- **Conventional commits** with descriptive messages
- **Logical commits** (one feature per commit)
- **Clean history** (no merge commits or noise)
- **Proper .gitignore** (no secrets, no artifacts)

---

## Performance Notes

- Next.js build: Fast (< 2 seconds)
- npm install: 33 seconds (524 packages)
- Database seeding: < 1 second
- Dev server startup: ~1.5 seconds
- Page load (dev): Instant

---

## Known Issues / Future Considerations

### None blocking, but noted:

1. **Moderate security vulnerability** in npm packages
   - Can run `npm audit fix` later
   - Not blocking for development

2. **Some deprecated packages** in dependency tree
   - From ESLint (upgrading to v9 later)
   - Not affecting functionality

3. **No actual photos in uploads folder**
   - Seed script references placeholder paths
   - Will need real photos or placeholders for Sprint 2 testing

4. **Email configuration not tested**
   - Left for Sprint 4
   - Nodemailer installed but not configured

---

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)

### Immediate priorities:

1. **Create dynamic campaign pages** (`app/c/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Fetch campaign by slug
   - Display neighborhood name
   - Show contractor info

2. **Build photo gallery component**
   - Grid or carousel layout
   - Support unlimited photos
   - Lazy loading
   - Lightbox for full-size view

3. **Create lead capture form**
   - Name, address, email, phone, notes fields
   - Client-side validation
   - Styling with Tailwind

4. **Create API endpoint** (`app/api/leads/route.ts`)
   - Accept POST requests
   - Validate data
   - Insert into database
   - Return success/error

5. **Add placeholder images**
   - Create or download sample roof damage photos
   - Add to uploads folder
   - Test photo display

---

## Sprint 2 Preparation

### Ready to start:
- ✅ Database has campaign data with slugs
- ✅ Test URLs available for development
- ✅ Database queries work for fetching campaigns + photos
- ✅ Next.js routing ready for dynamic pages
- ✅ Tailwind configured for styling

### Blockers: None

### Risks:
- **Photo display** will need placeholder images (can use public URLs temporarily)
- **Form submission** will need proper error handling (plan for it)
