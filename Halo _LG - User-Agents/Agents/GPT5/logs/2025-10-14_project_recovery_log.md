# Session: Project Recovery & Production Stabilization
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Agent:** GPT-5 (Project Manager)  
**Context:** Restart after crash; sync progress post-Sprint 3, guide production deployment

---

## 1. Repository & Sprint Status
- Verified Claude finished Sprint 3; reviewed codebase in `../HaloLG-CB`.
- Confirmed sprint deliverables (contractor wizard, uploads, QR generation) were committed and pushed.
- Located additional maintenance scripts/logs; ensured `.gitignore` covers service-account JSONs.

## 2. Production Deployment Support
- Walked user through Vercel domain setup; added `www` CNAME + apex A record → domain now serves production build.
- Provided high-level stack recap (Next.js + Firebase + Nodemailer + Vercel + Google Workspace).
- Clarified role separation: Vercel (web/DNS), registrar (domain ownership), Google Workspace (email).

## 3. Environment Variable Alignment
- Guided manual entry of `.env.local` values into Vercel (Production) with correct client/server exposure.
- Documented Firebase service-account handling: store JSON outside repo, load via `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
- Extended `.env.example` (pending commit) to remind future sessions.

## 4. Bug Fixes & Serverless Compatibility
- Resolved 413 upload errors by migrating `/api/campaigns/[id]/photos` and `/generate-qr` to Firebase Admin SDK.
- Added `lib/firebase-admin.ts`, `firebase-admin` dependency, and download-token URL generation.
- Fixed type mismatch by mapping camelCase keys when initializing `cert`.
- Multiple commits pushed to `origin/main`:
  1. `fix: use firebase admin for storage uploads`
  2. `fix: map firebase service account fields`
- Local `npm install` run (note: build warning about SWC deps still pending local Next.js dev run).

## 5. Operational Guidance
- Explained impact of auto-production deploys; suggested branching or manual deploys if builds become noisy.
- Provided DNS “stupid simple” instructions, debugging tips for `/api/campaigns`, and Vercel log usage.
- Called out Vercel build failure cause (`ServiceAccount` mapping) and corrected it.

## 6. Outstanding Items / Next Steps
1. Update `.env.example` with `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` template (not yet committed).
2. Rerun production deploy after setting `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` in Vercel.
3. End-to-end test on production once redeployed (campaign creation, photo upload, QR generation, email notification).
4. Optionally add client-side image compression or direct-to-storage uploads to avoid Vercel payload limits.
5. Consider disabling auto deploy on `main` or using staging branch to reduce build noise.

**Notes for Claude:**  
- Work resumed after Sprint 3 completion; current focus is Sprint 4 (notifications + launch).  
- Production now relies on Firebase Admin credentials via env var. Ensure future scripts/APIs use `lib/firebase-admin`.  
- Watch for pending `.env.example` update and any follow-up changes to logging/email templates.
